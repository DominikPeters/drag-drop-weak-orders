# drag-drop-weak-orders
JavaScript implementation of a drag and drop UI for weak orders (rankings with ties), based on the HTML5 drag and drop API. The code is vanilla JS, in the fully self-contained files `index.html` (horizontal version) and `vertical.html` (vertical version with horizontal indifference classes). At the time of development (April 2024), the drag and drop API was still not well-supported on mobile browsers, so I'm also loading a polyfill javascript file (https://github.com/Bernardo-Castilho/dragdroptouch), but this may become unnecessary in due course.
